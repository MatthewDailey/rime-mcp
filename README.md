# Rime MCP 

[![rime](rime-logo.png)](https://www.rime.ai)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides text-to-speech capabilities using the Rime API. This server downloads audio and plays it using the system's native audio player.

## Features

- Exposes a `speak` tool that converts text to speech and plays it through system audio
- Uses Rime's high-quality voice synthesis API

## Requirements

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- A working audio output device
- macOS: Uses `afplay`

There's sample code from Claude for the following that is not tested ðŸ¤™âœ¨
  - Windows: Built-in Media.SoundPlayer (PowerShell)
  - Linux: mpg123, mplayer, aplay, or ffplay

## MCP Configuration

```
"ref": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["rime-mcp"],
  "env": {
      RIME_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

      # Optional configuration
      RIME_GUIDANCE="<guide how the agent speaks>"
      RIME_WHO_TO_ADDRESS="<your name>"
      RIME_WHEN_TO_SPEAK="<tell the agent when to speak>"
      RIME_VOICE="cove" 
  }
}
```

All of the optional env vars are part of the tool definition and are prompts to 

All voice options are [listed here](https://users.rime.ai/data/voices/all-v2.json).

You can get your API key from the [Rime Dashboard](https://rime.ai/dashboard/tokens).

The following environment variables can be used to customize the behavior:

- `RIME_GUIDANCE`: The main description of when and how to use the speak tool
- `RIME_WHO_TO_ADDRESS`: Who the speech should address (default: "user")
- `RIME_WHEN_TO_SPEAK`: When the tool should be used (default: "when asked to speak or when finishing a command")
- `RIME_VOICE`: The default voice to use (default: "cove")
